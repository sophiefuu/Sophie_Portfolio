## [Project 1: Explainable AI]
User trust building through explainability in image classification tasks as part of skin cancer diagnosis app.
* Trained CNN model to classify skin images
* Implemented post-hoc explainability methods like LIME, ExMachina and occlusion
* Created web application for user tests to find best explainability methods for trust-building

## [Project 2: Anomaly Detection]
Anomalies detection in multivariant sensor data by comparing PCA and LSTM Autoencoder based methods for predictive maintenance applications.

Since this project was done in cooperation with a company, the data and specific code sections cannot be shown. Only a general source code is uploaded.
