## [Project 1: GoGirl]
GoGirl is a Go project created to learn Go programming by building a web service and web application.

## [Project 2: Explainable AI]
Trust in automated systems is becoming increasingly vital, especially where these systems are employed in critical contexts such as the medical assistant tools. With an user study, it is explored how explainability in AI applications can be used to generate trustworthy, accountable systems. 

This project included the following process sets:
* Training of CNN model to classify skin images
* Implementing post-hoc explainability methods like Integrated Gradient, Occlusion and LIME
* Creating a web application for user tests to find best explainability methods for trust-building

## [Project 3: Anomaly Detection]
Multivariant data analysis methods, namely PCA and LSTM Autoencoder, are applied to detect anomalies in the operating condition of control valves that are installed in a production plant. Built-in sensors record process parameters, such as stroke or signal pressure, which serve as a database. In the training process, a machine learning model is constructed and fed with normal historical data to learn an efficient representation of the healthy operating condition of the control valve. In the online anomaly detection phase, the goal is to detect the continuous degradation of the machine component. Therefore, data collected in the past week of the production process are processed by the loaded model to evaluate the current operating condition. The actual state is compared with the target state. The measured deviation represents the anomaly score. If the values are above a threshold defined in the training process, an anomaly is detected in the data. The analysis results are then integrated into a report for the plant operator. With this collected information, effective maintenance of the control valves can be planned and executed to reduce unnecessary repairs and unplanned machine downtime.

As the project was conducted with a partner company, data specific information cannot be shown due to privacy concerns.

## [Project 4: COVID Vaccine Distribution Analysis]
The analysis enables the maximization of vaccine capacity by identifying gaps in the delivery process, quality deficiencies and distribution bottlenecks - connecting all stakeholders: Vaccine manufacturers, suppliers, ministries of health, and vaccination centers - but the general population could also benefit from such insights.
In Germany, there are currently only selective KPIs for vaccine distribution, no process-based insights.
The analysis also provides a Bavaria-specific insight and benchmarking of suppliers - especially important for a diversified sourcing strategy like the German one.
