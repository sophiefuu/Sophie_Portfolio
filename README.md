## [Project 1: Explainable AI]
User trust building through explainability in image classification tasks as part of skin cancer diagnosis app.
* Trained CNN model to classify skin images
* Implemented post-hoc explainability methods
* Created web application for user tests to find best explainability methods for user trust-building

## [Project 2: Anomaly Detection]
Anomalies detection in multivariant sensor data comparing PCA and LSTM Autoencoder for predictive maintenance applications.
