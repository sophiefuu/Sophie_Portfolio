## [Project 1: Explainable AI]
User trust building through explainability in image classification tasks as part of skin cancer diagnosis app.
* Trained CNN model to classify skin images
* Implemented post-hoc explainability methods like LIME, ExMachina and occlusion
* Created web application for user tests to find best explainability methods for trust-building

## [Project 2: Anomaly Detection]
Anomalies detection in multivariant sensor data by comparing PCA and LSTM Autoencoder based methods for predictive maintenance applications.

Since this project was done in cooperation with a company, the data and specific code sections cannot be shown. Only a general source code is uploaded.

## [Project 3: COVID Vaccine Distribution Analysis]
The analysis enables the maximization of vaccine capacity by identifying gaps in the delivery process, quality deficiencies and distribution bottlenecks - connecting all stakeholders: Vaccine manufacturers, suppliers, ministries of health, and vaccination centers - but the general population could also benefit from such insights.
In Germany, there are currently only selective KPIs for vaccine distribution, no process-based insights.
The analysis also provides a Bavaria-specific insight and benchmarking of suppliers - especially important for a diversified sourcing strategy like the German one.
In creating it, the three thought of our health minister Jens Spahn as a persona - but the analysis can add various kinds of value.
